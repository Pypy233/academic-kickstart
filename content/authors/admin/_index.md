I am an undergraduate student major in Software Engineering in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/), China. I did research work in Nanjing University and Prof. [Enyi Tang](http://software.nju.edu.cn/eytang) is my fantastic adviser. I spent a wonderful summer internship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign hosted by Prof. [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io) in 2019. 
My research interests include programming languages, program analysis, numerical analysis using programming language techniques and security. I want to build tools and systems to guarantee the desired behavior of a system in a reliable and scalable way. I am now digging in interesting security stuff.
